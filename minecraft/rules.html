      <h1>Malainia Minecraft Server Rules</h1>
      <hr />
    </div>
    <h2>Rules for Gameplay, Game Chat, and Matrix Chat</h2>
    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        TurboHacker1024 reserves the right to change any rules at any time.
      </li>
      <li>You can be banned or muted for violating any of these rules.</li>
      <li>Treat others how you would want to be treated. Just be nice!</li>
      <li>
        This list is not exhaustive. Other behaviors not on this list may still
        be deemed unacceptable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No cheating or hacking with any kind of 3rd party mod or client.</li>
      <li>
        Do not kill players repeatedly without their permission, or in a manner
        that is upsetting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stealing is not strictly prohibited, however avoid doing anything that
        may ruin someone's day. Taking from chests is fine, but damaging bases
        is forbidden.
      </li>
      <li>Do not grief terrain or intentionally create ugliness.</li>
      <li>Repair creeper damage! DO IT IMMEDIATELY!</li>
      <li>
        Claim your land! If your base gets destroyed or your stuff stolen, you
        will wish you had learned to use Griefprevention!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the server PG.</li>
      <li>Do not promote other Minecraft servers or other chat rooms.</li>
      <li>
        Do not promote/post anything about Discord, Discord servers, or anything
        related to or associated with Discord. Malainia will NEVER go near
        Discord.
      </li>
      <li>
        No arguing or discussing politics/religion or any controversial topics
        unrelated to gameplay. Keep real life politics out of the game! PERIOD!
      </li>
      <li>Do not bully, insult, or harass other players.</li>
      <li>
        No cussing/cursing/swearing or bad jokes, not even implying it with
        alternative words/characters or abbreviations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not fight in chat with other players. No one wants to hear your
        drama!
      </li>
    </ul>
