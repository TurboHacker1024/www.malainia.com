    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I (known to the internet is TurboHacker1024) decided to create this site
      in the year 2021 because why not? I wanted a website and was not sure what
      to put on it, so I just made it and now I will try and find stuff to put
      on it!
    </p>
    <p>
      This site now has a variety of content such as information about my
      Minecraft server, memes I made with my friends, and anything else I happen
      to find interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the meaning of the name "Malainia?" Well I kind of forgot what it
      means, my friend and I made the word up when we were about 6 years old!
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this website from scratch writing my own HTML and CSS without
      any template. It may be ugly, but at least it is not bloated!
    </p>
    <p>And last but not least... We really really like chickens here!</p>
