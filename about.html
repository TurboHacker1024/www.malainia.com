      What is Chicken Malainia? What the heck does the word "Malainia" mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad you asked! Malainia was originally started by a close friend and I
      when we were about 6 or 7 years old (likely around the year 2009). My
      family had chickens living in the yard, so we often went outside to play
      with them or feed them. One spring there was a bush full of flowers and we
      collected the flowers and threw them to the chickens who happily ate them.
      My friend just randomly made up the word Malainia and it stuck. I would
      pull him around in a wagon while he threw flowers to the chickens and
      chanted “Chicken Malainia! Chicken Malainia!” Malainia became an imaginary
      kingdom ruled by my friend and the chickens were the people. The 4
      original chickens we had were named Stormy, Sunshine, Snowball, and Wendy.
      They became known as The 4 Founding Mothers of Malainia. The imaginary
      kingdom grew and grew, and my family eventually moved out of the city and
      into the country where we got even more chickens! We built forts, made
      bridges over the stream, built fires, created meals for the chickens out
      of corn and plants we found, and even created a “documentary” about how to
      care for chickens. As the years went on we grew older and the magic of
      Chicken Malainia began to fade away. By the time we were grown there was
      little left to the idea of Chicken Malainia other than a few remaining
      chickens.

      It was around the year 2018 when I became interested in computers and the
      internet. By 2019 I had figured out how to create a Minecraft server.
      Through great trial, error, and research I finally had a Minecraft server
      up. I built it into a small private online community and called it
      “Malainia.” The first server became known as Malainia Season 1. It was a
      success. As time went on, what was once the Kingdom of Chicken Malainia
      became fully virtual… a part of cyberspace. Into The Matrix it went…
      literally… as we chat on Matrix (check out matrix.org and element.io)
      After a while Season 1 died out and a second incredibly successful server
      called Malainia Season 2 was launched, which sometimes sustained more than
      10 players at a time during peak play time. Many friends came and went,
      and after a successful run of over a year Season 2 was retired. When the
      year 2021 came around I started a website, launched a full blown Matrix
      space/community, and started the great and final Malainia Season 3 server.
      Season 3 is now the current Minecraft server we play, and it is going to
      stay up forever as history is made, communities are built, and incredible
      mysteries and lore form about the map created by those who play. I am
      always looking to grow the community and invite new people, so let me know
      if you want to play and please invite your friends!

    <h2>The Website</h2>
    <p>
      This website is a work in progress, more of an experiment. Trying to fill
      it out with Minecraft content related to my servers. May also expand it to
      other things my friends are interested in such as art, drawing, and
      photography.
